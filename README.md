# FEND Capstone Project: Travel App

## Overview
This project aims to give you the opportunity to put all of the skills you have learned into one project to build your own custom travel app. Due to the nature of this course, it is very JavaScript heavy, but it is still expected you create clean and appealing HTML/CSS. You will also be targeting the DOM, working with objects, and retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. Finally, this is all going to be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server, and wrapped up with service workers.

For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. You should figure for every piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code. If it takes you 5 hours to figure out the logic, it should likely take you another 5 hours determining that you wrote the best code possible. As your skills improve, this process will feel more natural. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission.

The minimum requirements ask a fair amount from you, but the final app is quite simple. A roadmap to expand on the application and make it uniquely your own is provided.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the files. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
Introduction
This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs. Given that this is the Capstone project, it's highly encouraged for you to go above and beyond, adding additional functionality and customization to truly stand out with a project you are proud to have at the top of your portfolio!

Project Rubric
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the Travel Planner App project rubric. Please review for detailed project requirements.

Get the Starter Code
If you'd like to start from scratch without any files, you are encouraged to do so! You learn the most by developing on your own! But, it can be a bit challenging having to start from scratch. There’s not the standard starter code you’re used to. If you would like to start with starter code, duplicate your code from project 3 and start there. Here is just one possibility for the visual of this project. Of course, you can style it how you choose, and extending the project will dictate the final appearance.
